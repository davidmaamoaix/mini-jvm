# Mini-JVM
Mini-JVM is a simple C implementation of a Java Virtual Machine. It aims to provide the basic functionality of class-loading and code execution, as well as a CLI to manually manipulate the internals of the VM (e.g., manually class loading/unloading, method invocation, etc.) for fun and educational purpose.
